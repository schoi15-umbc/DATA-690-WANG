Science and technology are advancing every day. Due to the inventions and improvements, our daily life has become much more convenient and time efficient. Everything from what we eat, wear, live, to our work life and entertainment, technology is embedded into the tools we use. This is great. However, in order to have every tool to work for us, the tools need energy. It consumes different types of energy to make our life convenient, and at the same time, it is destroying our environment. The earth’s pollution is getting out of hand and significantly contributing to climate change. One big thing we can do to make effort of reducing pollution is to use less of nonrenewable energy resources such as coal, nuclear oil, and natural gas, and start using more of renewable energy such as solar, wing, water, biomass, and geothermal. In this article, we will be comparing several countries’ consumption of renewable energy by the country’s land size with GDP per capita and Education. The countries were selected in diverse area and size.

Countries Compared: United States, Brazil, China, United Kingdom, New Zealand, India, Costa Rica, Mexico, Kenya. 

Timeline: 2010 - 2015

Indicators: 
* (Education) Barro-Lee Average years of total schooling, age 15+ total : Average years of primary schooling, 15+, total is the
average years of primary education completed among people over age 15.

* (Climate Change) Renewable Energy Consumption (% of total final energy consumption) : Average years of primary schooling, 15+, 
total is the average years of primary education completed among people over age 15.

* (Environment) Land Area (sq.km) : Land area is a country's total area, excluding area under inland water bodies, national claims to 
continental shelf, and exclusive economic zones. In most cases the definition of inland water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.

* (Economy & Growth) GDP per capita (current US$) : GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. 
GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not 
included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for
depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.
